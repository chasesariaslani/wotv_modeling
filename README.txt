Shiny R application
You will need to open the global.R, server.r and ui.R as well as set the
working directory to where the character CSV files are to run the application.
The www folder is meant for images used in the application.
The wotv_test_hypothesis.R file is for analysis using t-statistc.

than non-limited UR characters.
